CHANGES:

1. The Username and Password boxes will display red if the user/pass combination is incorrect. The issue is that if you then put in the correct combination while the borders are still read, navigate to the "create account" section, then navigate back, the borders revert to black, indicating that the current input is the correct one. This could lead to security issues later on.
